# Small Talk (for D&D Fifth Edition)

A module that makes chat messages smaller.

## What it does 
Reduces the size of dnd5e chat cards including overall space, button size, margins, portrait size, subtitle size, and so on.
- Provides a setting to hide the portrait image.
- Provides a setting to hide the subtitle (username).
- Provides a setting to hide images on item cards.
- Provides a setting to hide subtitles on item cards.
- Provides a setting to make the hit checks vs AC blue rather than green (for red green colorblindness or aesthetic reasons).
All settings are off by default.

## Compatibility
I have not tested compatibility with any other modules that modify chat cards, and unless I use that module myself I am unlikely to (see CONTRIBUTING.md for more info). The only module I personally tested for compatibility is my other chat card based module [Effective Tray](https://github.com/etiquettestartshere/effectivetray).
